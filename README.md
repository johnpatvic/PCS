# Passenger Control System

        Passengers overload in buses both in public and private has been a problem in India.
    Despite some stationing police at different locations for manual check being in
    place, the overloading of passengers still persists. The current system doesnâ€™t work
    efficiently as the check is done at random, and it is difficult during the rainy
    seasons and at night and it is costs and needs labor power. The findings indicate
    that many deaths and injuries when accidents occur, they cause deaths and injuries
    mainly if there is passenger overloading. Many people lose their lives and some are
    severely injured when accidents occur in these buses. This paper checks an overview on the
    current system and proposes a new system which uses new technology for
    controlling passengers overload in buses to overcome these challenges of the
    current system. The proposed system will help in controlling excessive passengers
    and hence reduce the number of deaths and severe injuries,reduce cost and labor power. Finally the standard and
    comfortable passenger system for buses can then be attained.
